Below is the complete, updated README.md file for your Hinglish Voice-AI fine-tuning mini-project. This version incorporates all necessary details, including Windows-specific setup instructions, design rationale, and a note about the quota issue you encountered (with expected sample outputs, as fine-tuning hasn’t completed due to $0.00 credits). It aligns with your project requirements, the current state of your work in C:\Users\jayap\assin-ai\hinglish-voice-ai, and the submission deadline of April 29–30, 2025. The file is ready to be used in your GitHub repository and reflects the fallback plan since you’re unable to proceed with fine-tuning due to the OpenAI quota limit.

# Hinglish Voice-AI Fine-Tuning Mini-Project

## Overview
This project aims to fine-tune a GPT-3.5-turbo model using the OpenAI API to create a Voice-AI that handles code-switched Hinglish dialogue. The deliverables include a dataset, fine-tuning and inference scripts, and this README with setup instructions and design rationale. Due to OpenAI quota limits ($0.00 credits), fine-tuning could not be completed, but the dataset was uploaded (file ID: `file-8vyXgNedfbtsGhsMZWijZu`), and expected outputs are provided based on dataset patterns.

## Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```cmd
   pip install openai
Set Environment Variable:
On Windows, set your OpenAI API key:
cmd

Copy
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
Run Fine-Tuning:
Execute fine_tune.py to upload dataset.jsonl and start fine-tuning:
cmd

Copy
python fine_tune.py
Note the fine-tuned model ID from the OpenAI dashboard or API response.
Run Inference:
Update inference.py with your fine-tuned model ID.
Run:
cmd

Copy
python inference.py
Deliverables
dataset.jsonl: 15 Hinglish prompt-completion pairs.
fine_tune.py: Script to upload dataset and start fine-tuning.
inference.py: Script to generate responses from the fine-tuned model.
README.md: This file with setup, design rationale, and outputs.
Note on Quota Issue
Fine-tuning could not be completed due to OpenAI quota limits (error: exceeded_quota, $0.00 credits remaining). The dataset was successfully uploaded (file ID: file-8vyXgNedfbtsGhsMZWijZu), but the fine-tuning job failed to start. Sample outputs below are based on expected model behavior derived from the dataset patterns.

Design Rationale
Dataset Selection & Size
Why 15 examples? A small dataset (10–20 pairs) is sufficient for a 2-hour prototype to demonstrate fine-tuning. 15 pairs balance variety and manageability within the project scope.
Domains & Style: Examples cover casual conversations (greetings, plans, suggestions) and daily activities (weather, food, tech), reflecting typical Hinglish use in urban Indian contexts. The style is informal, mirroring natural spoken dialogue suitable for a Voice-AI.
Length: Prompts are short (1 sentence) to simulate voice inputs, with completions under 20 words for concise, voice-friendly responses.
Model & Hyperparameter Choices
Model: GPT-3.5-turbo:
Chosen for its balance of cost, speed, and performance in chat-based tasks.
Preferred over Davinci (a completion model) as Hinglish Voice-AI requires conversational context handling, which turbo’s chat format supports natively.
Hyperparameters:
Epochs: 2: Sufficient for a small dataset to adapt the model without overfitting. More epochs risk memorization given the dataset size.
Learning Rate: Used OpenAI’s default, optimized for small datasets to minimize divergence risks in a prototype.
Why? These choices prioritize quick iteration, cost-efficiency, and effective adaptation to Hinglish patterns.
Prompt Formatting & Generation Settings
Prompt Format: Used messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}] to align with GPT-3.5-turbo’s chat API, ensuring compatibility with fine-tuned model expectations.
Settings:
Temperature: 0.7: Balances creativity and coherence for natural Hinglish responses without overly random outputs.
Max Tokens: 50: Ensures concise responses, matching the dataset’s style and Voice-AI’s need for quick replies.
Why? These settings mimic real-world voice interactions, prioritizing naturalness and brevity.
Evaluation in Production
Human Review: Collect feedback from native Hinglish speakers on response fluency, cultural relevance, and tone.
Automated Metrics: Use BLEU/ROUGE for response similarity to ideal outputs, though limited by Hinglish’s variability. Track perplexity for model confidence.
A/B Testing: Compare fine-tuned model against base GPT-3.5-turbo on user satisfaction metrics.
Why? Combining human and automated evaluation ensures linguistic accuracy and user engagement, critical for Voice-AI.
Sample Outputs
Note: Actual outputs could not be generated due to fine-tuning failure (OpenAI quota limits). Below are expected outputs based on the dataset patterns:

Prompt: "Mujhe ek chai pilao."
Response: "Ek garam chai bana deta hoon, thodi der mein ready!"
Prompt: "Weekend ka kya plan hai?"
Response: "Chalo, dost ke saath hangout karte hain ya movie dekhein?"
Prompt: "Koi funny video suggest kar."
Response: "YouTube pe 'BB Ki Vines' dekh, hasi nahi rukegi!"

### How to Use This `README.md`
1. **Create/Update the File**:
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     ```cmd
     cd C:\Users\jayap\assin-ai\hinglish-voice-ai
Open README.md in a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).
Copy-paste the above content, replacing the existing content.
Save the file.
Verify Other Files:
Ensure dataset.jsonl, fine_tune.py, and inference.py are in C:\Users\jayap\assin-ai\hinglish-voice-ai and match the versions provided in my previous responses (OpenAI SDK 1.0.0+ compatible).
